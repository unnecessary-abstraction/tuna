% TUNA Project: Roadmap
% Paul Barker
% July 2013

This roadmap outlines the intended features for the first few releases of TUNA. 
It is not intended to be binding, just a place to dump thoughts of mine on what 
order things should be done in and when a release should be made.

# Version 0.1

Basic demonstration version with a test program `tuna`.

# Version 0.2

Minimally usable version of recording/analysis binary.

- Input from ads1672 if possible

- Support for both time slice and event analysis

# Version 0.3

Focus on library usability

- libtuna: Usable as both shared or static library

- Documentation: For both users and developers

- Testsuite: Low coverage test suite

# Version 1.0

- Finish up binary usability

- Enhance documentation

- Stabilize libtuna API

- Expand test suite to very high code coverage
