- Standardise exit functions so they all gracefully ignore NULL pointer
  arguments. This will simplify error handling and exit code as we won't need to
  check whether objects have been initialised yet.

- Rename _init functions which allocate new objects to _new and _exit functions
  which destroy objects to _delete as this will make much more sense.

- Write unit tests using Python bindings.
	- cbuf
	- csv
	- timespec
	- offset_threshold
	- onset_threshold

- Write plotting scripts using Python binding and use these to validate the
  implementation of various mathematical operations.
	- env_estimate
	- minima
	- offset_threshold
	- onset_threshold

- Write integration tests in Python. These will generally cover the producers
  and consumers.
	- analysis
	- bufq
	- consumer
	- input_ads1672
	- input_sndfile
	- output_sndfile
	- producer
	- pulse
