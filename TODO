- Standardise exit functions so they all gracefully ignore NULL pointer
  arguments. This will simplify error handling and exit code as we won't need to
  check whether objects have been initialised yet.

- Rename _init functions which allocate new objects to _new and _exit functions
  which destroy objects to _delete as this will make much more sense.

- Write unit tests using Python bindings.

- Write integration tests in Python.
