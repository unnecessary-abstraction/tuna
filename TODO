- Add doxygen comments to all headers.

- Standardise exit functions so they all gracefully ignore NULL pointer
  arguments. This will simplify error handling and exit code as we won't need to
  check whether objects have been initialised yet.

- Write unit tests using Python bindings.

- Write integration tests in Python.
